               <h2>1970s</h2>
            <p>Since its origin, the last Jubilee concert was held April 30 to May 2, 1971 with performers including Chuck Berry, Spirit, Cowboy, Muddy Waters, the J. Geils Band, the Allman Brothers, and Tom Rush, among others. Due to growth each year, the weekend concert attendance was 49,500 for Friday, Saturday and Sunday shows.</p>
            <p>A week after the festivals were held, Student Activities Group decided Jubilee should be discontinued due to the increasingly rowdy, noisy and reckless behavior exhibited by students. According to The Daily Tar Heel back issues, cries of discontinuation had been heard since at least 1965. The group recommended programming throughout the year instead.</p>

               <h2>1980s, 1990s, 2000s</h2>
            <p>The tradition of a spring concert couldn't be stopped. In 1979, the first annual Springfest was held, sponsored by Student Congress and HRC. In 1980, the first annual Chapel Thrill concert was held, large productions with a budget of $150,000 in the 1981-1982 year. For comparison, that was the entire budget of the Student Union at the time. In 1982, the Chapel Thrill concert made more than $23,000 in profit. </p>
            <p>But around 1987, Chapel Thrill came to an end after a struggle for financing, followed by the end of Springfest in 1992.</p>
